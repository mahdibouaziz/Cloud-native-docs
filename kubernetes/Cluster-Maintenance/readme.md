# Cluster Maintenance

## Introduction to Cluster Maintenance 


Kubernetes clusters require management practices to ensure that nodes, PODs, and other resources operate optimally. Cluster maintenance practices fall under three broad categories: 

* Operating System Upgrades, 
* Cluster Upgrades
* Backup & Restore Methodologies.  

This section takes the candidate through various cluster maintenance processes, including upgrading the Operating System, the implications of evicting a node from the cluster, Kubernetes Releases & Versions, the cluster upgrade process, and upgrade best practices among others. Through live practicals, the candidate will perform an end-to-end cluster upgrade, which helps to get familiar with cluster administration tasks required for both the CKA Exam as well as professional practice. The course also takes on a real-world disaster recovery scenario where the candidate performs backup and restore practices to bring a failed cluster back to a working state.
